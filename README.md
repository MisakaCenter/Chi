# What is Chi?
🍀Chi is a subset of Common Lisp, implemented in Python3. Yet another mal, but with a funny lexer.

This name 'Chi' is 迟 in Chinese. You can get more information about it in https://github.com/Chi-Task-Force/



# Example?
Here you can use `我太菜了` `我是废物` to form a program


For example, if you want to do some easy calculations, you can write in this way:
```
Chi> 我太菜了 加 1 1 我是废物
2
```


If there are something wrong, you will get:
```
Chi> 我太菜了 我是废
<Error> 等死吧，傻逼
```
